üõí ECommerce SaaS Platform
    A modern multi-tenant, multilingual SaaS eCommerce application built using Next.js, MongoDB, JWT, Stripe, and NextAuth. This project supports subdomain-based B2B multi-tenancy, role-based access control, dynamic language switching, and automated product translation using MyMemory Translation API.

üöÄ Key Features:
üîê JWT Authentication:
    Secure login system using custom JWT tokens.
    JWT contains user ID, role, organization ID, and expiration.
    Stored securely in cookies for each user session.
    Token contains:
    user ID
    role
    organization ID
    Stored in secure HttpOnly cookies

üß† Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
    Three user roles: admin, staff, and user.
    Access managed through permissions:
    Admin: Full CRUD rights.
    Staff: Limited rights (e.g., view/manage products).
    User: View-only access to allowed resources.

üè¢ B2B Multi-Tenant System (Organization-Based) 
    Each organization (tenant) operates on a virtual subdomain (e.g., org1.myapp.com, org2.myapp.com).
    Data such as products, users, and settings are isolated by organizationId.
    Middleware ensures that all access is scoped to the current organization.
    Admins can only manage data within their organization. 

üì® User Invitation System via SMTP
   Admins can invite users (admins or staff) to join the platform by email.
   Invitation links are sent via SMTP mail server.
   Invitees can register, set password and name, and are then onboarded with the role assigned in the invite.
   Secure registration flow for invited users only.

üì¶ Product Management
   Products are stored with multilingual support using translation objects.
   Each organization manages its own product inventory.
   Products can be created, updated, and deleted by authorized roles (admin/staff).

üí≥ Stripe Subscription & Payments
   Integrated Stripe Checkout for secure payments.
   Multiple plans (Free, Pro, Premium) with recurring billing options.
   Stripe metadata maps features to each plan.
   Webhook handlers update MongoDB with subscription lifecycle events (active, cancelled, etc.).

üåç Internationalization (i18n) ‚Äì Multilingual Support
   This SaaS platform supports multilingual content and localized routing using a robust and automated internationalization system built with Next.js App Router, MyMemory Translation API, and MongoDB.
  1.  Built-in internationalization (i18n) using Next.js App Router.
  2.  Product content is auto-translated using MyMemory API.
  3.  Automatic translation of product content via MyMemory API
  4.  Supported Languages: English (default), French, German.
  5.  Admin enters product content in English; translations in fr and de are generated and stored in MongoDB.
  6.  Users can choose their preferred language, which is saved in their user profile (MongoDB).
   Language preference is auto-applied on login via cookie and database sync.
   User language preference saved in cookies and database
   Languages:--
   English (default )  
   French
   German
   Product content auto-translated and stored per language
   Language preferences stored in the database
   Reference: Next.js Internationalization Guide


   üß© Multilingual Implementation Steps
   1. Dynamic Locale Routing
   2.  All routes are structured using a dynamic [lang] segment, e.g.:
   /en/products
   /fr/products
   /de/products

   The application uses middleware.ts to detect and redirect based on:
    Translation Files (JSON-based)
    src/lib/dictionary/en.json
    src/lib/dictionary/fr.json
    src/lib/dictionary/de.json
    
    Keys are extracted using i18next-parser:
    npm run extract:i18n

    Using Translations in Components
    const t = useTranslations();
    ("homepage.description");
    
   Auto Translation via MyMemory API
   Products are stored in MongoDB in the following structure:
   {
  name: {
    en: "iPhone",
    fr: "iPhone",
    de: "iPhone"
  },
  description: {
    en: "A smartphone by Apple.",
    fr: "Un smartphone d'Apple.",
    de: "Ein Smartphone von Apple."
  }
}
 Admin enters content in English; backend auto-translates to other languages during product creation.


üõÇ Social Authentication
   Login via Google, Facebook, and GitHub using NextAuth.js.
   OAuth users are assigned roles and tokens just like traditional logins.
   Secure flow combines OAuth with custom JWT for role and organization enforcement. 

üîó OAuth Login Integration
    Supports login via:
    Google
    Facebook
    GitHub
    Integrated with NextAuth and custom JWT logic
